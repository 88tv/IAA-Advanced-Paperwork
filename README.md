# IAA Advanced Paperwork
This is a collection of files designed for the Internal Affairs Agent to use in cases of reporting breaches of Standard Operating Procedure, usually to the Nanotrasen Representative. If you have any suggestions for changes to these forms, you can find me on the [Funkystation](https://funkystation.org/ "Funkystation") discord under the handle 8tv. These forms were highly inspired by @TheTyto's [SS14-Advanced-Paperwork](https://github.com/TheTyto/SS14-Advanced-Paperwork "SS14-Advanced-Paperwork") system for the Head of Personnel.
## Tips
* To fill out a box, you're going to have to escape the "[X]" with a backslash "\", or else SS14 will treat it as a bullet.
* It's usually better to send paperwork as the IAA only when you HAVE to. I often find myself giving Quartermaster's second and third chances to locate their order forms, for example, and will only resort to filling out a SOP breach when things truly get bad.
