# IAA Advanced Paperwork
This is a collection of files designed for the Internal Affairs Agent to use in cases of reporting breaches of Standard Operating Procedure, usually to the Nanotrasen Representative. If you have any suggestions for changes to these forms, you can find me on the [Funkystation](https://funkystation.org/ "Funkystation") discord under the handle 8tv. These forms were highly inspired by [TheTyto](https://github.com/TheTyto)'s [SS14-Advanced-Paperwork](https://github.com/TheTyto/SS14-Advanced-Paperwork "SS14-Advanced-Paperwork") system for the Head of Personnel.
## Organizing
* All departments have a "general" report and job-specific reports. You are intended to fill out both a "general" report and job-specific reports for any breach of SOP you find, potentially allowing you to condemn an entire department in one shared report.
* Most command members are placed not in the "Command" folder but instead within their respective departments, under -00.
* The Internal Affairs Agent and the Lawyer are placed under the "Legal" department even though this isn't an actual department. Blame Legal SOP being where their Procedures go.
* All forms have jobs and specific areas color-coded for the department they're referring to, with some jobs (The clown and the mime) having special colors for their jobs rather than using the default service color.
## Tips
* To fill out a box, you're going to have to escape the "[X]" with a backslash "\\", or else SS14 will treat it as a bullet.
* It's usually better to send paperwork as the IAA only when you HAVE to. I often find myself giving Quartermaster's second and third chances to locate their order forms, for example, and will only resort to filling out a SOP breach when things truly get bad.
